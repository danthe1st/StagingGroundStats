# Staging Ground statistics

I took the last 100 pages of Staging Ground approvals from the review history, grouped these by user, filtered out inactive users and created bar charts out of it.

The ones with "big" in the name include all users who contributed more than 5 of these approvals, ones marked "small" only include users who contributed more than 20 of these approvals.

The horizontal lines represents the median.

- Approval count is the total number of questions the reviewer has approved.
- Sum is the sum of votes/views of all questions the reviewer has approved.
- Mean refers to the mean votes/views on questions approved by the reviewer.
- interquantile mean is the mean excluding outliers (anything smaller than the 10%th quantile or greater than the 90% quantile)
- count positive-negative is the number of questions with a positive score minus the number of questions with a negative score approved by the reviewer
- count is the total number of closed/deleted questions or answers to questions the reviewer has approved
- ratio is the total count divided by the approval count i.e. the ratio of closed/deleted questions (or mean number of answers, I know the title doesn't fit here)
