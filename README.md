# Staging Ground statistics

I took the last 100 pages of Staging Ground approvals from the review history, grouped these by user, filtered out inactive users and created bar charts out of it.

The ones with "big" in the name include all users who contributed more than 5 of these approvals.

The horizontal line represents the median.
